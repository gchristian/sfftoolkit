SFFToolKit is an application to support the card game <a href="https://solforgefusion.com/">SolForge Fusion</a> by <a href="https://www.stoneblade.com/">Stoneblade Entertainment</a>. It is unaffiliated, unendorsed, and entirely unofficial. It relies on publicly accessible APIs that may or may not continue to work.


Features:
- Create dividers for oganizing your deck collection. The dividers contain the name of the deck, the rarity icons for all cards in the deck, and the number of spells in the deck.
- Sort dividers by faction, then alphabetically by deck name or by deck name only
- adjust height of the divider (it assumes horizontal), depending on how tall your box is you may lose the rarity icon row. I wouldn't go lower then 2.9 to get the best results.
- generate labels to print for deck box tops/sides that contain the same information as dividers plus creature names
- extract card images from the card montage used by TTS, one image per card per level
- generate a local html/js file of all your decks/cards with stats/abilities that can be filtered and searched
- printable single page (at least for my decks so far) summary of decks
- csv dump of half deck data
- whole collection stats

Known issues:
- If you provide a filename without a .pdf, it will overwrite a file without warning. If you include the .pdf in the save dialog, it will ask first.
- The initial download of images the first time doesn't have great feedback that its working. This can be a while if -- you have a lot of decks (mine is 100MB of images and takes a quick minute or two).

To do:
- provide option for vertical dividers
- write data directly onto deck box template, so you can print and fold your own deckbox

I havenâ€™t done GUI development in over a decade, and used this project as an excuse to learn how to do it in a cross platform way with python (in a previous life I was rather proficient in Obj-C/Cocoa but nowadays I mostly do backend stuff and in python). So its a mix of coding conventions and i'll try to get around to normalizing it at some point. Since its wxWidgets based it might be best to use their naming conventions, but thats going to be a bit of an adjustment for me.

You can run the app from source by installing the dependencies and running python ssftk.py (or python3 if your python command is 2).
